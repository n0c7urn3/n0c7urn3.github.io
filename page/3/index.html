      Honestly, I spent a bit of time trying to catch up on sleep before the conference really got underway. Las Vegas is more than a little stimulating to the senses, and the packs of roving hackers at Defcon doesn’t help that.
In years past, I’d join Line-con around 3-4 AM to guarantee I didn’t end up with a paper badge (my first year was the first year that they had to resort to that from what I was told), but this year, I decided to get a little bit of sleep after meeting up with one of the Gothcon folks the night before, and wound up getting to the line around 615AM, 15 minutes after registration opened.

      Day -1: The Drive I have forgotten how much the drive to Las Vegas takes it out of you. My first time in Vegas was just for a friend’s birthday party. We (my friend, her boyfriend, and I) piled into my Subaru Forester, and off we went. We took turns driving on the way there, and on the way back, I decided to challenge myself. I drove the entire way home myself, and we only stopped for gas.

      As a warning, this post has content relating to death, depression, and alcohol abuse.
I resented my father. Past tense. For a couple of reasons. The obvious one is that he passed shortly before I turned 18. The other reason is that I’ve come to terms with our differences.
My father loved me. He adored me. And he wanted the best for me (even threatened to leave my mother and take me with him during a time when her drug use was at one of its peaks), and he did his damndest to provide for me and my mother.

      I think we all have a specific moment in which we learn to trust that little voice in the back of our heads; the one that tells us, “You should run.” Sometimes it’s wrong, and you have to look at the situation to figure that out, but sometimes listening to it is the best choice you can make.
To provide some background, both of my parents were recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, and both attended our local Alcoholics Anonymous club (henceforth referred to as “the Club”).

      Yay, first “Personal” category post!
So, I’m definitely not “cool” enough to have people tracking my every move (except for my assigned FBI agent. Hi!), but if you look at my #100daysofcode tracker, you might notice only a single tally mark since the original publication, and a total of “1.5.” How could I have completed 1.5 days of code?
Well, I got sick. It’s just a cold, but colds knock me out pretty bad, and they’re viruses, so not much can be done about them outside of fluids/rest (technically, I suppose antibiotics could treat them, but I’m not contributing to the overuse of antibiotics).
