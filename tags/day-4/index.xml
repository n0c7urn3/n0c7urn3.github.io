      <description>The day started with much grunting trying to get the energy to roll out of bed. We werenâ€™t hung over, just exhausted. The night had ended around 430AM, and we were attempting to get out of bed to join the Cryoflesh folks for Brunchcon (now with 300%-500% more feral hogs!). After an hour of hitting snooze, we got dressed, rinsed the grime off, and wandered over.
A lot of good conversation was had while eating, and I realized mid-conversation who I was speaking to (this was a common thing during the weekend).</description>
