      <description>Yay, first &amp;ldquo;Personal&amp;rdquo; category post!
So, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; enough to have people tracking my every move (except for my assigned FBI agent. Hi!), but if you look at my #100daysofcode tracker, you might notice only a single tally mark since the original publication, and a total of &amp;ldquo;1.5.&amp;rdquo; How could I have completed 1.5 days of code?
Well, I got sick. It&amp;rsquo;s just a cold, but colds knock me out pretty bad, and they&amp;rsquo;re viruses, so not much can be done about them outside of fluids/rest (technically, I suppose antibiotics could treat them, but I&amp;rsquo;m not contributing to the overuse of antibiotics).</description>
