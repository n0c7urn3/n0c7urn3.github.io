      <description>The following is part 5 of the Incident Response Plan that I submitted as my final capstone project for my BS in CyberSecurity at Colorado Technical University, and was originally written March 18, 2018. I decided to publish it to demonstrate the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done, as well as in the hope that someone will get some benefit from it.
