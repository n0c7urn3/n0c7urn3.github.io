      <description>Section 4: Asset Security Management Security practitioners face many issues when determining best how to secure an organization, but asset management is among the most challenging and the most critical. One cannot protect what one does not know exists. A properly executed IT Asset Management program could mean the difference between a well run network and a hodgepodge of poor documentation that creates easily access footholds for attackers.

Incident Response is no different, and is dependent upon the strategies that come before it, and informs those that come after.</description>

      <description>The following is part 2 of the Incident Response Plan that I submitted as my final capstone project for my BS in CyberSecurity at Colorado Technical University, and was originally written March 18, 2018. I decided to publish it to demonstrate the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done, as well as in the hope that someone will get some benefit from it.
 Section 2: Data Governance Every organization should abide by a data governance program.</description>
