      <description>As a warning, this post has content relating to death, depression, and alcohol abuse.
I resented my father. Past tense. For a couple of reasons. The obvious one is that he passed shortly before I turned 18. The other reason is that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to terms with our differences.
My father loved me. He adored me. And he wanted the best for me (even threatened to leave my mother and take me with him during a time when her drug use was at one of its peaks), and he did his damndest to provide for me and my mother.</description>
