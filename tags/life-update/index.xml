      <description>It has been 3 months. And before that it had been 2. I&amp;rsquo;m sure not updating this as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to, but it seems that when I have the time, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy, and when I have the energy, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time, and when I do have both, I just don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say.
I finished my studying for CompTIA CySA+ back in September and have plenty of notes that I plan to turn into posts.</description>
