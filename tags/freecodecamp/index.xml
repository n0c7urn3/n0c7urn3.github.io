      <description>I have decided to take part in #100daysofcode (as a start). I intend to work my way through the curriculum at FreeCodeCamp, in part because they offer fairly comprehensive web development courses, and in part because they get you in contact with non-profits to donate your time and skills, and I want to do good in the world. Yes, I do want the ability to add these items to my portfolio, but I want so badly to work on something I can believe in.</description>
