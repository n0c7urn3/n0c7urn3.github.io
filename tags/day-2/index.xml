      <description>Day two was interesting. I didnâ€™t exactly get to do the networking I wanted, but maybe the networking I needed. We started with brunch at Le Village Buffet with a few other members from the DeadPixelSec Discord (fabulous bunch of people), and then wandered over back to Planet Hollywood with another goth to see the CyberSeXurity panel by Alison Falk, Lora Haddock, and Katelyn Bowden.
The talk centered on gender equity in tech, and how double standards are pervasive in law and society, and what we can do to make tech a more equal place for everyone across the gender spectrum.</description>
