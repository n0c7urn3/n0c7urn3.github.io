      <description>I will not purport to be an expert on hardening systems, especially since this is really my first attempt to do so. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit more than some, especially since alot of people just use the default and they&amp;rsquo;re done. I also know I&amp;rsquo;ve probably got quite a bit more I can do.
The first thing I did (which really should not have been the first thing I did, as you&amp;rsquo;ll see my order to be a bit flawed on priority) was to install and enable an SSL certificate.</description>
