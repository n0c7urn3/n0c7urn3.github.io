      <description>The day started with much grunting trying to get the energy to roll out of bed. We weren’t hung over, just exhausted. The night had ended around 430AM, and we were attempting to get out of bed to join the Cryoflesh folks for Brunchcon (now with 300%-500% more feral hogs!). After an hour of hitting snooze, we got dressed, rinsed the grime off, and wandered over.
A lot of good conversation was had while eating, and I realized mid-conversation who I was speaking to (this was a common thing during the weekend).</description>

      <description>Saturday started, like the previous days, at lunch. One of the DeadPixelSec members hit a pretty decent payout and bought us all lunch. Over lunch, we all talked about what we do professionally, what brought us to Defcon, and what we’ve been doing at Defcon. My interactions with these folks have been overwhelmingly positive, on Discord and in person.
We then wandered from there to the vendor room. I didn’t buy anything, but as mentioned in the Day Two coverage, I donated some money for Dead Addict, and the gentleman who bought us lunch, and had the sticker pack thrust upon me (and I’m now an EFF member).</description>

      <description>Day two was interesting. I didn’t exactly get to do the networking I wanted, but maybe the networking I needed. We started with brunch at Le Village Buffet with a few other members from the DeadPixelSec Discord (fabulous bunch of people), and then wandered over back to Planet Hollywood with another goth to see the CyberSeXurity panel by Alison Falk, Lora Haddock, and Katelyn Bowden.
The talk centered on gender equity in tech, and how double standards are pervasive in law and society, and what we can do to make tech a more equal place for everyone across the gender spectrum.</description>

      <description>Honestly, I spent a bit of time trying to catch up on sleep before the conference really got underway. Las Vegas is more than a little stimulating to the senses, and the packs of roving hackers at Defcon doesn’t help that.
In years past, I’d join Line-con around 3-4 AM to guarantee I didn’t end up with a paper badge (my first year was the first year that they had to resort to that from what I was told), but this year, I decided to get a little bit of sleep after meeting up with one of the Gothcon folks the night before, and wound up getting to the line around 615AM, 15 minutes after registration opened.</description>

      <description>Day -1: The Drive I have forgotten how much the drive to Las Vegas takes it out of you. My first time in Vegas was just for a friend’s birthday party. We (my friend, her boyfriend, and I) piled into my Subaru Forester, and off we went. We took turns driving on the way there, and on the way back, I decided to challenge myself. I drove the entire way home myself, and we only stopped for gas.</description>

      <description>As a warning, this post has content relating to death, depression, and alcohol abuse.
I resented my father. Past tense. For a couple of reasons. The obvious one is that he passed shortly before I turned 18. The other reason is that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to terms with our differences.
My father loved me. He adored me. And he wanted the best for me (even threatened to leave my mother and take me with him during a time when her drug use was at one of its peaks), and he did his damndest to provide for me and my mother.</description>

      <title>Trusting Your Gut</title>

      <description>I think we all have a specific moment in which we learn to trust that little voice in the back of our heads; the one that tells us, &amp;ldquo;You should run.&amp;rdquo; Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s wrong, and you have to look at the situation to figure that out, but sometimes listening to it is the best choice you can make.
To provide some background, both of my parents were recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, and both attended our local Alcoholics Anonymous club (henceforth referred to as &amp;ldquo;the Club&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <title>Importance of Taking Care of One&#39;s Health</title>

      <description>Yay, first &amp;ldquo;Personal&amp;rdquo; category post!
So, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; enough to have people tracking my every move (except for my assigned FBI agent. Hi!), but if you look at my #100daysofcode tracker, you might notice only a single tally mark since the original publication, and a total of &amp;ldquo;1.5.&amp;rdquo; How could I have completed 1.5 days of code?
Well, I got sick. It&amp;rsquo;s just a cold, but colds knock me out pretty bad, and they&amp;rsquo;re viruses, so not much can be done about them outside of fluids/rest (technically, I suppose antibiotics could treat them, but I&amp;rsquo;m not contributing to the overuse of antibiotics).</description>

      <title>100 Days of Code</title>

      <description>I have decided to take part in #100daysofcode (as a start). I intend to work my way through the curriculum at FreeCodeCamp, in part because they offer fairly comprehensive web development courses, and in part because they get you in contact with non-profits to donate your time and skills, and I want to do good in the world. Yes, I do want the ability to add these items to my portfolio, but I want so badly to work on something I can believe in.</description>

      <description>Two years ago today, I walked into CenturyLink for my first day. I was nervous as hell, and, coming out of the MSP/desktop support space, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was going to be able to do the work, but a friend of mine that I met while attending ITT knew I was looking and referred me.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing, she said I should do it before we ever even finished our degrees, and that was back in 2013.</description>

      <title>Hardening</title>

      <description>I will not purport to be an expert on hardening systems, especially since this is really my first attempt to do so. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit more than some, especially since alot of people just use the default and they&amp;rsquo;re done. I also know I&amp;rsquo;ve probably got quite a bit more I can do.
The first thing I did (which really should not have been the first thing I did, as you&amp;rsquo;ll see my order to be a bit flawed on priority) was to install and enable an SSL certificate.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few websites in the past: A website called Newb Sec that I and a friend were going to use as a blog together (that would have satisfied many of the goals for this website), and a website for a residential computer repair business that I was trying to start as a means to try to transition into working for myself (which was misconceived for the amount of time I actually had to dedicate to it, working a full time job as is, and going to school full time).</description>
