    <p>I think we all have a specific moment in which we learn to trust that little voice in the back of our heads; the one that tells us, &ldquo;You should run.&rdquo;  Sometimes it&rsquo;s wrong, and you have to look at the situation to figure that out, but sometimes listening to it is the best choice you can make.</p>

<p>To provide some background, both of my parents were recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, and both attended our local Alcoholics Anonymous club (henceforth referred to as &ldquo;the Club&rdquo;).  I know some people that really don&rsquo;t like A.A. for the emphasis that it puts on God, and I&rsquo;m personally not in favor of organized religion, but it works for a lot of people.  Growing up, I spent a lot of time at the Club, and I saw lots of people turn their lives around.  I attended Alateen (a meeting for teenage children of alcoholics), and in hindsight, I think it did help me, at least to not feel so alone.</p>

<p>Some people, though, don&rsquo;t change.  At the Club, there was a crew of handymen that worked together and formed a company, and when I was sixteen, my parents decided to renovate the house and hired them.  We were familiar with most of the crew, but there was one guy who was new to the Club and new to the crew, I&rsquo;ll call him M.</p>

<p>M, by all accounts, was a good worker, and the work that he did do was of good quality.  He was friendly and people liked him, except for me.  I could never put my finger on what it was, but I just didn&rsquo;t like him and mistrusted him.  Over several months of working with the crew, though, he had earned my parents&rsquo; trust, and, notably, my dog&rsquo;s trust.  This was huge because my dog didn&rsquo;t like anyone, especially men, unless they had come over 500 times.  Even my best friends growing up each had to be over every weekend for 4 months before she would stop barking at them, but here was M, able to approach and pet my dog right off the bat.</p>

<p>People tend to put a lot of weight into their animals&rsquo; perception of people, and my parents did no different.  Eventually we had him working on our house without the rest of the crew if the job was small enough.  After some time, my parents felt comfortable enough with him to have him house sit while we were out of town.  I still didn&rsquo;t trust him, but didn&rsquo;t say anything because I didn&rsquo;t think I would be taken seriously.</p>

<p>When we returned, I found that M had cleaned my room.  To be fair, I was and still am not a neat person, and it needed to be done, but to have him do it while we weren&rsquo;t even in the same state&hellip;  I felt violated, especially after he had told me that he played my GameCube, which meant that he spent leisure time in my bedroom.  I was internally recoiling, but I still didn&rsquo;t say anything.  He continued to work on our house, both alone and with the rest of the crew, and even came to visit with my parents.  Until one night, my mother&rsquo;s car was stolen.</p>

<p>He had been over to some work earlier in the day, and I&rsquo;d seen him go into the garage, but didn&rsquo;t think much of it.  That night, I was in my bedroom playing my N64, and my mother thought that she had heard some my father come home from a meeting at the Club, but when she went downstairs, she didn&rsquo;t see him, so figured she didn&rsquo;t hear anything.  When my father did come home, however, he popped his head in my room and asked where my mother was.  Confused, I replied that she was in their room.  With more confusion, he told both of us that her car was missing.</p>

<p>While waiting for the police, my father and I went into the garage, trying to figure out what happened.  I told him that it was M.  He didn&rsquo;t believe me at first, until I laid it out for him:</p>

<p>Earlier that day, M had gone into the garage for some reason.  Standing there with my father, I lifted up the garage door, showing that it had been disengaged from the garage door opener.  My mother had thought she heard my father come home; she thought she heard the door open, and with no barking from my dog, she thought it was my father, but nobody was downstairs.  He had disengaged the garage door from the opener so that he could open it quietly, and had entered the house to get her keys.</p>

<p>At this point, the police hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet, and my father was still doubtful, so we went looking for M&rsquo;s van.  We didn&rsquo;t find it in the immediate area, but my gut told me to look in the parking lot of the nearby apartment complex, and we found it there.  It was at this point that I finally told both of them that I had never trusted him.  When my mother asked me why I didn&rsquo;t say anything, I told them truthfully that I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be taken seriously, and my father, to his credit, admitted that I was probably right.</p>

<p>The car was recovered a month later.  M had drunkenly driven it into a ditch in the next state over.  When the police returned, they didn&rsquo;t remove his belongings, and we discovered no liquor bottles, but alcoholic mouthwash instead.  He was so far off the right path to be drinking mouthwash to get drunk.  I feel for him, and hope that, since then, he&rsquo;s gotten back to the right path, but I hope to never see him again.</p>

<p>I never could put my finger on why he felt off, but he did, and I&rsquo;ve learned to trust that instinct.  It&rsquo;s served me a few times, warning me to stay away from some people who were found to be horrible people, and it has been wrong on a few counts as well, but it&rsquo;s how I learned to trust my judgement and speak up about it.</p>
