  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Two years ago today, I walked into CenturyLink for my first day.  I was nervous as hell, and, coming out of the MSP/desktop support space, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was going to be able to do the work, but a friend of mine that I met while attending ITT knew I was looking and referred me.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, she said I should do it before we ever even finished our degrees, and that was back in 2013.  But I wasn&rsquo;t confident in my skills, then, so I told her, &ldquo;Maybe when I&rsquo;ve got some more experience and can actually do the work.&rdquo;  And then I spun my wheels in desktop support for a while.</p>

<p>For the next three years, I would work at MSPs, and while I learned a lot in those jobs, it&rsquo;s not something I enjoyed, especially since at one of them, for most of my tenure, I was the only full time employee.  At both of them, it was extremely stressful, and it impacted my mental health immensely (I had other things going on in my life that were unhealthy, it wasn&rsquo;t just work, but that&rsquo;s planned for a future post).</p>

<p>In summer 2016 (which will get a whole post at some point), I was let go from the last desktop support job, and decided that I needed to get a few things ironed out in my personal life, but that I wouldn&rsquo;t be going back to desktop support.  So, after taking a couple of months to get my head back on straight, I drove Lyft for a while, which was hard in other ways, but I mostly made it work.  I gave myself six months of driving Lyft.  I told myself I would not let this become a situation where I have income, so I&rsquo;d do the safe thing of staying in a job I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy doing (not that I hated it, I enjoyed meeting interesting people).</p>

<p>I used Lyft to get back on my feet (if you look at my resume page, this is during the gap), and once my deadline was coming up, I started studying for my Network+ certification between rides.  This was something I&rsquo;d started and stopped studying for a few times before, always telling myself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for studying something that isn&rsquo;t my degree,&rdquo; which was an excuse I told myself, when in reality I was just trying to remain comfortable and not take risks.  Studying in between rides was a fantastic use of that downtime, and I supplemented it with practice exams at home when I was starting to feel comfortable with the material, and in April 2017, I took the test and passed with a healthy margin.  Around that time, I reconnected with my friend from school, and she showed my resume to my now supervisor, and told me to apply.</p>

<p>A week after that, I started applying for a few places, in addition to CenturyLink.  I had a total of four  applications and interviews during this process.  There was a SOC position with an infosec company that I really wanted, an engineer position with a hosting company, a desktop support position with a software company (which I would have taken if nothing else panned out, they paid extremely well and were within walking distance of home, but I would have been bored, and I answered honestly when the interviewer asked that), and the Ethernet technician position with CenturyLink.</p>

<p>The infosec company told me to try again when I had some more security experience, the hosting company told me they wanted me, but didn&rsquo;t have anything on my preferred shifts (swings and overnight at that point) at the time, and I never heard back from the software company.  In my interview with CenturyLink, though, they flat out told me they were going to make an offer, and by the time I made it down the street to get lunch, my recruiter had already heard from them and I had the offer in hand.</p>

<p>Due to the background check and drug testing requirements, it took a couple of weeks before I was able to start, but because I had the offer, I consider myself to have made good on my six month timeline with Lyft, and walked in for my first shift two years ago to this day.  And, despite my nervousness, once I got into the swing of things and saw what we were doing, I flat out told my friend, &ldquo;<em>This</em> is what I was nervous about?  This is what I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had psyched myself out about the work, buried myself deep in imposter syndrome, told myself four years prior that I couldn&rsquo;t do it, without ever letting myself try it.  And since I&rsquo;ve been at CenturyLink, I&rsquo;m still working on the same team, but I&rsquo;ve been converted from contractor to full time employee, I&rsquo;ve been promoted.  I do most of the line testing, I train new people, I have some of the highest productivity numbers.  <em>I have excelled.</em>  I have excelled at something I could have been doing <em>4 years prior</em> if I listened to those around me instead of listening to my doubt.</p>

<p>I have learned so much working this job, and though I feel like I&rsquo;ve plateaued, I have learned plenty that will make me a better security practitioner once I&rsquo;m doing that.  And next time I&rsquo;m looking for a new job (preferably to move roles within CenturyLink), I&rsquo;m not going to let myself be afraid to apply, even if it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve got much experience with.  When we grow, we should be going for goals that are above us, because we don&rsquo;t grow otherwise.</p>
