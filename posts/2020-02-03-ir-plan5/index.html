<h1 id="section-5--compliance-with-security-regulations">Section 5:  Compliance with Security Regulations<a href="#section-5--compliance-with-security-regulations" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Although they are responsible for securing the organization, security teams typically do not have a legal background when it comes to knowledge of compliance requirements for a given organization or industry.  Additionally, the compliance requirements are written at a high level and lack technical depth, in part because the writers lack a technical background.  It is therefore imperative for $Company to have employees on staff with a legal background who are able to communicate with the IT security teams to ensure that they are securing the organization within compliance of legal and industry regulations.  Likewise, the security teams should have employees on staff who are able to communicate what they are doing to meet those requirements (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 20).</p>
<p>Although most regulations carry steep penalties for violations, regulations comes in both federally enforced and privately enforced varieties.  A sampling of different regulations is as follows, including the enforcing body(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)—Enforced by the US Government and enacted in 2002, FISMA exists to provide a framework to address the widespread adoption of the internet among government agencies and standardize information security controls across different agencies (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)—Enforced by the US Government and enacted in 2002, SOX resulted from fraud and accounting failures at companies such as Enron and WorldCom.  The act was put into place in order to provide transparency into and restore trust into the financial reporting of publicly traded companies (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 31).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)—Enforced by the US Government and enacted in 1999, GLBA governs the protection of personally identifiable information held and used by financial organizations and organizations that interact heavily with this data.  The Act is divided into three primary rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Financial Privacy Rule, which concerns the collection and disclosure of personal financial information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Safeguards Rule, which concerns the protection of personal financial information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Pretexting Rule, which concerns the unauthorized access of data under false pretense (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p.33-34).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)—Enforced by the US government and enacted in 1996, HIPAA concerns personal health information and defines how it can be used, by whom, and under what circumstances (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 35).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)—Enforced by the US Government and enacted in 2000, CIPA concerns the ability of children of 18 to access explicit material online, such as pornography, and requires the use of internet filters as a condition of schools and libraries receiving public funds (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 35).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)—Enforced by the US Government and enacted in 1974, FERPA concerns the privacy of student education records, and provides parents with the right to access educational records until the age of 18 or entrance to post-secondary education (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 35).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)—Enforced by the Payment Card Industry Security Council (PCI DSC), PCI DSS is a contractual obligation that anyone who collects, stores, or uses cardholder data must adhere to, and contains three ongoing steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assess—Identifies cardholder data and IT infrastructure on which it may reside or pass through and ensures that all impacted infrastructure is properly protected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remediate—Remediates security shortcomings in affected infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report—Requires the organization to report breaches, test results, and remediation. Necessary for record keeping and compliance (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 42.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red Flags Rule—Enforced by the Federal Trade Commision, the Red Flags Rule requires credit unions and banking organizations to implement an identity theft prevention system in order to detect anomalies on banking accounts that may represent fraud or identity theft (Weiss &amp; Solomon, 2011, p. 45).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="incident-response-certificationsaccreditations">Incident response certifications/accreditations<a href="#incident-response-certificationsaccreditations" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Certifications and accreditation are a controversial topic in information security.  On the one hand certifications, in theory, show that the holder has a certain level of knowledge.  On the other hand, certifications frequently do not provide a demonstration of hands on knowledge, and in some cases may be given by certification mills that do not adequately teach the subject matter (Tara, 2018, p. 12).  Regardless of the controversy, many organizations look for individual who hold certifications, both on the basis that the holder should have the requisite knowledge the certification represents, and on the basis that the organization can then leverage that certification in their own negotiations.</p>
<p>Cyberdegrees.org lists several desirable certifications for an incident responder to hold, issued by a multitude of organizations, many of which are also shared by computer forensics examiners:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Certified Computer Examiner (CCE) by the International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners (ISFCE)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) by the EC-Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIAC Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE) by the Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA) by the Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH) by the Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst (GCIA) by the Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certified Computer Forensics Examiner (CCFE) by the Information Assurance Certification Review Board (IACRB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certified Penetration Tester (CPT) by the Information Assurance Certification Review Board (IACRB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certified Reverse Engineering Analyst (CREA) by the Information Assurance Certification Review Board (IACRB)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>As has been reiterated throughout, a breach or intrusion is an inevitability.  To modify the Infinite Monkey Theorem:  Given an infinite number of monkeys on an infinite number of terminals, one of them will hack your organization.  Although no failure should be treated lightly, every failure should be treated as a learning opportunity.  As with every aspect of security, incident response is not fire and forget, but rather a cycle that concludes with revision and review before beginning the cycle anew, taking what lessons can be learned and rolling them into the assessment phase of the next.</p>
<p>Although incident response is the last line of defense when something goes awry, it should never be treated as an isolated part of any security programs, nor should any other part.  Each aspect of security informs and is informed by the other aspects.  Security is an ecosystem, and the removal of any piece will result in imbalance, and if not rectified, collapse. Security teams should work with each other, and with business owners throughout the organization to understand what needs protecting, the impact of failure, and how to recover.  Good security relies on communication and the sharing of information.  Although hackers are often vilified, not all are criminals, and many more work to secure systems than they do to break them (and the best defenders are those that think like an attacker), and at the heart of the hacker ethic, there is the “belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible” (Raymond, 2003).</p>
<p>In every failure is an opportunity to learn, and a wise man learns from the failures of others.</p>
