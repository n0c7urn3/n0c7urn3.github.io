    <p>Day -1: The Drive I have forgotten how much the drive to Las Vegas takes it out of you. My first time in Vegas was just for a friend’s birthday party. We (my friend, her boyfriend, and I) piled into my Subaru Forester, and off we went. We took turns driving on the way there, and on the way back, I decided to challenge myself. I drove the entire way home myself, and we only stopped for gas. And holy crap it was a mistake. Nothing bad happened, but I needed to sleep for about a day at the end of it.</p>

<p>The next time I went to Las Vegas was for Defcon 22, my first Defcon. My then girlfriend, who didn’t drive, found someone online to drive with, using the carpool section of the Defcon forum. He was a nice enough guy, but didn’t click super strong with us, and we fell out of contact. It was nice to have the other driver, though, which was something that was driven home the next year for Defcon 23.</p>

<p>As mentioned, my then girlfriend didn’t drive, so it was all on me since we were unable to find a carpool buddy. I was so tired by the time we rolled into town. And the way back was even worse, and made the first time I decided we needed to stop at a rest stop for sleep. We flew for Defcon 24.</p>

<p>I missed the last two years (25 and 26), but was able to attend this year. I’ve missed it greatly. We were torn about whether to fly or drive, initially, but two weeks before the conference, we received a letter stating that the condo HOA was repainting the lot the week of Defcon. We were able to find a place to store my partner’s car, but had difficulty finding somewhere to store mine, so we drove.</p>

<p>The drive was particularly rough for me. Working the overnight shift and having sleep issues in general, my sleep was especially bad this week, granting me only a few hours of sleep a day. Plus, Tuesday, we were still making final preparations (packing, dropping my cat off with a sitter, etc.), so my sleep was poor Tuesday, as well.</p>

<p>It was nice to have another driver again, though, having my partner available to take shifts with. Both of us being sleep deprived, we still had to stop for a couple of hours of sleep, but we made it farther than we otherwise would have with either of us on our own, and didn’t have to stop as long, and rolled into town around 1130AM.</p>

<p>Day 0</p>

<p>After some time spent wandering the mall and grabbing a bite to eat, we were able to check into our hotel and get a few hours of sleep before I did my traditional “I have a bottle of mead and need help drinking it” post on social media, and met up with someone from the Gothcon Slack channel. When we met him, he was talking with a drunken man who claimed to be a recruiter. He was quite amusing, especially when he read off my “Hacker Small Talk” T-Shirt. The T-Shirt lists several common security questions, and not only did he read the questions, but he answered them, which makes it my most successful social engineering attempt. Then he offered to buy my hair for $8,000, which I declined, tempting as it was.</p>

<p>We also had a random person join us because we “looked like the cool kids.” We talked shop for a bit (mostly about IT/infosec between myself and the person from the Slack channel, and literature between my partner and our new friend, as well as our local goth communities among the four of us).</p>

<p>So ended Days -1 and 0. The next day, Defcon would officially begin!</p>
