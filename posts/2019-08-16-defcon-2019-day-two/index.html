    <p>Day two was interesting. I didn’t exactly get to do the networking I wanted, but maybe the networking I needed. We started with brunch at Le Village Buffet with a few other members from the DeadPixelSec Discord (fabulous bunch of people), and then wandered over back to Planet Hollywood with another goth to see the CyberSeXurity panel by Alison Falk, Lora Haddock, and Katelyn Bowden.</p>

<p>The talk centered on gender equity in tech, and how double standards are pervasive in law and society, and what we can do to make tech a more equal place for everyone across the gender spectrum. People from all walks, including myself, were able to ask questions after they finished their led discussion. It was good to see a lot of people asking how to be better allies (something I’ve struggled with and am still trying to navigate myself), and even though I thought some of the questions were a bit odd, they were handled by both the panel and the attendees really well (shoutout to another audience member for answering my question with the panel’s permission, and shoutout to my partner for realizing I didn’t know how to phrase my question and picked up on where I was going).</p>

<p>I made a few new friends at the panel from the audience (including a pair trying to make #birdsec a thing, which I’m all for), which was fantastic, and was able to introduce myself to Katelyn Bowden (whom I admire) without fanpersoning too hard. After that, it was to meetup with folks from GothCon again at a Sushi place for dinner. There was a lot of talk about what we all do and what we hope to do, as well as what we can do better. There was a particular gentleman at dinner who, frustrated with trying to enter the private sector from the public sector, and being unable to meet the very strict requirements that hiring managers set on job reqs, and has decided to start a local conference specifically for those in the IT/Infosec roles, and those who are decision makers in local government, which is very sorely needed.</p>

<p>After dinner, we made to our hotel room, and I promptly realized I had made one of the most n00b moves I could have and had left my debit card at the restaurant (not recommended)! I quickly rushed back over to the restaurant, heart pounding as I dodged the crowds. I was very lucky that it was found by the restaurant staff (I had left it in the check presenter). On my way back, our new goth friend from the DeadPixelSec discord stopped me for a moment, but in my post adrenaline rush, I could barely muster “Hello.”</p>

<p>After a little cooldown in the hotel room, we made it to the 303/Skytalks Pajama Party and, after bouncing back and forth between there and Blanketfort con, hung out with our 303 friends for a little bit. We then rejoined our new goth friend and made it over to Queercon, with three other new friends in tow.</p>

<p>This was the first time I’d ever gone to Queercon, even though I’d been to three other Defcons, and I had a blast. It was held at the Alexis Park, which is a major part of Defcon history, and a place I’d never been. We were only there for an hour, but we met a few new people (and ran into the birdsec folks again), including the only person I’ve ever met who recognized the ReBoot tattoo on my arm!</p>

<p>After Queercon shut down and we trickled out, we got the opportunity to share a cab with Dead Addict, one of the OG Defcon folks. He was really chill and I didn’t fanperson too hard at him either. He paid for the cab, and when I tried to hand him a fiver, he insisted I give it to the EFF instead (which I did the next day). We had a discussion on hacker community drama in the cab, and he offered only that as long as the scene has existed, there has always been drama, which honestly, any community where people congregate, will be true.</p>

<p>This marked the end of the night, and I got some needed rest for Saturday.</p>
