    <p>Honestly, I spent a bit of time trying to catch up on sleep before the conference really got underway. Las Vegas is more than a little stimulating to the senses, and the packs of roving hackers at Defcon doesn’t help that.</p>

<p>In years past, I’d join Line-con around 3-4 AM to guarantee I didn’t end up with a paper badge (my first year was the first year that they had to resort to that from what I was told), but this year, I decided to get a little bit of sleep after meeting up with one of the Gothcon folks the night before, and wound up getting to the line around 615AM, 15 minutes after registration opened.</p>

<p>I’d forgotten how efficiently the lines move at Defcon (once they start moving), especially compared to other fan-conventions (anime, scifi, steampunk) conventions that I’ve worked and attended. I still remember talking to one of the Goons at Defcon 22 and hearing that it was their most chaotic con yet and remarking that, as someone who’s worked conventions, that I couldn’t tell. I got in and out in 30 minutes, though I lost my sunglasses going for one of the balls that was bouncing around the line. At least I brough a second pair!</p>

<p>After that it was back to the room for a little bit more sleep (4 hours total) before meeting up with the Gothcon folks with my partner so that she could interview them for her dark culture zine. It was mostly her talking with them, but it was cool hanging out with those folks for a couple of hours and hearing about how long they’ve been at Defcon and participating in goth and goth-adjacent subcultures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were a couple of things that I missed because of it, but it was a good time, so I’m not upset. I had intended to bring my partner to Defcon 101, but it actually seems like it may be a good thing that we missed it, from some of the chatter online.</p>

<p>Afterward, we went back to the room for a little bit to try to figure out how I want to play this Defcon. Every year I do Defcon, I do things differently, and get more and more out of it. My first year was spent mostly going to talks, and then I realized almost everything I want to see is published online after the con anyway, so in following years, I minimized the talks a bit. That’s not to say I won’t go to them, though. If it’s particularly interesting, or if it’s led by a friend of mine, I will absolutely go. I just don’t spend all my time in panels anymore.</p>

<p>My second year, I participated in the OpenCTF and boy did I learn a lot, especially how much I don’t know! We didn’t get very far, but I had a lot of fun. My third year took place during one of the hardest times in my life (that will be detailed in a series of posts another time), but I spent some time in Skytalks and just generally trying to break out of my shell and talk to people. I also helped out Mohawk-con for a bit since I knew some of the people working there (and was dating one at the time).This year, I’m thinking the name of the game is networking professionally.</p>

<p>Security has been where I wanted to be since I read the book Little Brother by Cory Doctorow. Looking back at my life, there have always been the inclinations of the hacker. I would take stuff apart to look at the inner workings and learn how they work, to the point my parents would hide screwdrivers from me. Then there was a friend who actually got me interested in computers and IT, beyond my general interest in the new and shiny. He lent me coding books, which I never actually worked through because I couldn’t focus (which I think may have been undiagnosed ADHD, and is something I’m working on getting an assessment for). It was him who taught me the difference between a hacker and a cracker, and despite me explaining the difference, I was discouraged from it by my parents because when I say “hacker,” they heard “criminal.” My mother was ignorant, and my father was, in all honesty, a luddite, so it’s not surprising, especially with the portrayal in the media at the time (that does persist, to an extent).</p>

<p>Rejoining the convention floors, I met up with a friend of mine at the tail end of the Denver City Sec meetup (super weird to have a Denver meetup in Vegas) at a small bar across the street from Bally’s. I used to work with this friend at my first MSP, and we meet up a couple of times a year to catch up and have drinks, often at Defcon. He left the MSP to work for a small security firm and handled alot of the sysadmin-type stuff, in addition to pentesting clients, and earlier this year, went independent. He said it was really scary, but he’s doing enough to support himself. I’m sure it’s a lot of work, but really freeing at the same time. Then he brought up the Randori party, and sent me the Eventbrite link.</p>

<p>He had mentioned that they had posted on the Colorado=Security Slack and had a challenge to exploit a site to get the registration link, but I missed it. Even though I’m on the Slack channel, I’m not spending much time on it, in part because they only time I have to be active is when everyone else is asleep (curse this night-shift). Still, I was able to register myself and my partner.</p>

<p>While walking over, I kept repeating the name “Randori” trying to remember why the name had significance to me, until it clicked that I had heard it from the Colorado=Security podcast a few times, and in general had heard that they were a decent place to work and to learn and grow. I had actually added them to a Keep note back in May 2018. So this made me excited to go the party.</p>

<p>Once upstairs, I chatted with a few folks from Randori after having a couple of drinks from the bar. I was still a bit overstimulated, but the alcohol calmed me down a bit. I had a good chat with one of their techs who pretty much started in a networking position like I’m in now before making the move to security, which was encouraging to here, and I briefly chatted with who I gathered was the party organizer, before joining the introvert room and playing Mario with a few people hanging out in there, before our exhaustion finally caught up with us again and we made it back to the room.</p>

<p>If this year was the year to try to network, I was off to a good start.</p>
