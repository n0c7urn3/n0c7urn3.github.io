    <p>The day started with much grunting trying to get the energy to roll out of bed. We weren’t hung over, just exhausted. The night had ended around 430AM, and we were attempting to get out of bed to join the Cryoflesh folks for Brunchcon (now with 300%-500% more feral hogs!). After an hour of hitting snooze, we got dressed, rinsed the grime off, and wandered over.</p>

<p>A lot of good conversation was had while eating, and I realized mid-conversation who I was speaking to (this was a common thing during the weekend). Katy Levinson had done a couple of talks in years past about how we’re doing robots wrong, and just like Renderman, she was amazed that I remembered her talks.</p>

<p>Officially, Brunchcon ended, but the owners of Cryoflesh sat around and chatted with us a while after everyone cleared out. There was a little bit of catching up, but most of it centered around some of the challenges they were facing after having bought the company. We agreed to help rep them when we get home, and will try to get them in touch with event organizers in our area for if they want to either fly out to man a booth or ship out stuff for someone else to man a booth (which we offered). I also spoke with the co-owner who has participated in CTFs quite a bit, and whose team now organizes OpenCTF at Defcon.</p>

<p>Once housekeeping showed up, we realized it was time to go to closing ceremonies. It was an emotional time as the organizers went over their challenges and successes through the year. We watched the Black Badge award ceremonies (disappointed that the raffle was trolling attempt that went a little too far, but hey, I got a neat little souvenir in the form of five tickets).</p>

<p>We contemplated spending the rest of the evening with our new and reunited friends, but decided a night to ourselves was needed prior to the drive home the next day. Ultimately, I don’t think I networked in the way I intended, and I definitely didn’t get alot of things done that I wanted, but I got a lot more done than I think I would have if I’d been more rigid. I just kind of went with the flow and hung out with people.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think really what I needed was not an educational or even really a professional experience, but a time to just have fun and relax around like-minded people. Next year, I do want to try to do some workshops and spend some time in the villages, but if I have half as much fun as I did this year, even if I don’t get into the villages, it won’t be wasted.</p>
