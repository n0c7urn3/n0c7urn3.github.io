    <p>As a warning, this post has content relating to death, depression, and alcohol abuse.</p>

<p>I resented my father.  Past tense.  For a couple of reasons.  The obvious one is that he passed shortly before I turned 18.  The other reason is that I&rsquo;ve come to terms with our differences.</p>

<p>My father loved me.  He adored me.  And he wanted the best for me (even threatened to leave my mother and take me with him during a time when her drug use was at one of its peaks), and he did his damndest to provide for me and my mother.  He was an artist; he painted, he drew, but his real passion was woodworking.</p>

<p>Professionally, he was a carpenter, specifically a cabinet maker, and damn good at it.  He was dedicated to his job, and even more dedicated to us.  As a toddler, I remember often he would be home after I&rsquo;d been put to bed, and he&rsquo;d leave for work the next day before I woke.  Oftentimes, I wouldn&rsquo;t see him during the workweek, but he always made sure to spend time with me on the weekends.</p>

<p>He spent most of the weekend with me outside.  Weather permitting, he would do gardening (we had tomato and pepper plants in addition to flowers, and he was always happy to indulge me wanting to &ldquo;help&rdquo;), or he would have some woodcarving project (I remember him working on a woman turning into a bird for over a year and wish I had it, but he sold it).  The thing I remember most (and what teenage me would find embarassing) was his sunbathing in his Speedo.  My best friend&rsquo;s mother jokingly referred to him &ldquo;The Sun Goddess.&rdquo;  He got me all sorts of sports equipment and would play with me as well.  Last but not least was the kiddie pool that was always set up on the weekends for when we needed to cool down.</p>

<p>He also made me wooden toys.  And I&rsquo;m not talking about a carved bear; he made me a wooden bulldozer with a scoop that lifted and had wheels that turned.  And it was sturdy enough to stand up to me, and I was not easy on my toys.  When I went through my train phase he made me a train engine that, again, had turning wheels, but the hubs for the wheels were enclosed.  I don&rsquo;t have the train anymore, but I do have the bulldozer.</p>

<p>This is the vision of my father that I try to keep with me:  The fit, dedicated, motivated man who would do anything for me.  It&rsquo;s not, however, the vision of him that frequently enters my mind.</p>

<p>When I was 7, I think, he tore his rotator cuff in his left shoulder.  He took Workman&rsquo;s Comp., and some time off, and went back when he was cleared by his doctor, but that was too soon.  As soon as he came back, he re-tore the rotator cuff, and it never healed properly.  This was a man who included &ldquo;carpenter&rdquo; in his definition of who he was, and it crushed him.  I&rsquo;m not sure why he never found another job, maybe as a foreman or some other management role (he certainly had the experience), but he never did take another job.  A part of him died when he got hurt.</p>

<p>He tried to stay fit for the next couple of years, and continued to carve wood as a hobby (and got rather good at doing it with one arm with limited movement).  After a few years though, he started gaining weight and stopped excercising, and towards the end, he&rsquo;d stopped his woodcarving.  In <a href="/posts/2019-06-06-trusting-your-gut/">Trusting Your Gut</a>, I mentioned that both of my parents were recovering alcoholics.  When I was 10, my father&rsquo;s mother died (his father had died when I was 6, on my birthday, actually), and a few months after that, he relapsed.  At that point, my father had 14 years of sobriety that ended.</p>

<p>I remember leaving school that day, and my best friend&rsquo;s brother met us by the schoolgate and told us that I had to go to his house because my father was taken to the hospital.  He&rsquo;d drank too much and triggered a seizure and a heart attack while going down the stairs to the basement.  The fall broke his hand, but thankfully, that was it.  He got some screws in his hand to hold it together, and had a pacemaker installed.  There were a few more relapses over the years, but this was the event that seemed like the turning point that I saw him change (although, if you ask my mother, she&rsquo;d tell you that it was when he got hurt).</p>

<p>A few months later was when I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder (which I plan to detail in a future post, once I get some other stuff figured out), and shortly after that, he was diagnosed as well.  My mother had already been diagnosed years before, so we jokingly, and unhealthily, referred to our household as the House of Bipolar.  This is around the time that I really started to see a decline.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Bipolar was an accurate diagnosis, or if he went for it based on my mother &ldquo;diagnosing&rdquo; it in everyone close to her, but regardless of what it was, neither he nor his doctor&rsquo;s managed it effectively.  He fell into a deep depression, and stopped sleeping in my parents&rsquo; bed and instead slept in his recliner in the living room (an interesting reversal from when my mother slept on the couch for reasons I&rsquo;m unclear on).  Not just a few times would he fall asleep with the TV on (it was funny how I&rsquo;d change the channel and an hour later he&rsquo;d wake up and tell me to change it back and that he was &ldquo;just dozing&rdquo;) or with a cigarette in his hand (he had many fleece blankets and sweatpants with holes burned in them, and the chair itself had patches over the burns, and the floor in front of the chair and to the side had burns; I&rsquo;m not sure how he didn&rsquo;t set the house on fire).</p>

<p>In addition to the relapses, he fairly frequently had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance after losing consciousness or having a seizure.  This was directly caused by his failing health.  He just at some point had stopped taking care of himself.  There was only one time that I can recall that he willingly went to the hospital:  My mother had been missing for a day, and after calling around, I found out that she had been taken to the hospital after a DUI (far from her first).  My father at the same time was having one of his periods where he needed medical attention, and I managed to convince him to go by pointing out that I couldn&rsquo;t take care of him and shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to at 16.  I made the deal I would find a friend&rsquo;s house to go to until one of them was released, and get someone who could take him instead of having to go in an ambulance.  And he went willingly, instead of me having to wait until he had a seizure or lost consciousness.</p>

<p>This downward spiral was what planted the seeds for my resentment, having seen the man I once admired become someone who could barely take care of himself.  What really did it, though, was my mother.  I don&rsquo;t know if she realized what she was doing and did it intentionally, but she turned me against him (I do think it was intentional since she was very good at manipulation).  Under the guise of &ldquo;treating me like an adult&rdquo;, as a teenager, she started treating me like a confidant and a friend, instead of a parent.  Someone to complain to, and she told me every grievance she had with him, instead of working through it with him.  I can&rsquo;t remember any specifics at this point, but it was I think alot of it was insinuating that he was lazy and had given up, and I started to resent him for it.</p>

<p>When I was 17, I had one of the best things that could have happened to me.  My mother went to jail for DUI for 90 days.  This wound up being a blessing in disguise.  At this point, I refused to be alone in the house with him, so I went to stay with a family friend in Greeley.  V, for some reason agreed to take me in for those 3 months.  While I was with her, she slowly opened my eyes to what my mother did.  I was resistant at first, but I started to see, and once I did, she asked me to finish the time my mother was in jail with him, and I agreed.  He came to pick me up, and on the way back, I told him what V helped me see, and I asked him if we could start over.  He started crying on the highway.</p>

<p>I wish so much that this had a happy ending.  I wish so much that I could say that we repaired our relationship.  I wish so much that I could say he started taking better care of himself and that he&rsquo;s here today.  I can&rsquo;t say any of that, though.  All of that stuff takes time, and I didn&rsquo;t get that.  Two weeks after we had that conversation, the years of not taking care of himself caught up to him, and he died.  Officially, the cause of death was respiratory failure, but I don&rsquo;t call it that.  He died due to severe depression, he died because he didn&rsquo;t take care of himself, I call that a form of suicide.  It&rsquo;s one that I got to see happen over almost a decade.  And I was <strong>so</strong> <strong><em>ANGRY</em></strong>.  I felt robbed.  I felt like a promise had been broken.  And I was was filled with rage.  I saw him in the ICU while he was in a coma right after having been rushed to the hospital, and my last words to him were, &ldquo;You finally did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I resented him for years leading up to his death, and regretted my final words afterward.  There were some good moments through his final years, but not many stuck in my memory.  To his credit, though, he kept trying to have a relationship with me.  At some point, I think he realized he was never going to have the father-child relationship with me he once had, and at least tried to have a friendly one with me, not that I was willing at that time to even do that, not until the end.  I might have come to resent him without the manipulation, but at least that would have been my resentment.  Or if I hadn&rsquo;t come to resent him, things might have ended differently.  But none of us can change the past.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come mostly to terms with his death over the years.  The wounds heal, but they scar deeply, and the scars don&rsquo;t fade.  7 years ago, my mother and I scattered his ashes on Rabbit Ears Pass, just outside of Steamboat Springs, which was one of his favorite parts of the state, and I try to make it up once a year, around Father&rsquo;s Day if I can.</p>

<p>Not everyone can have a relationship with their father, but if you can, please do.  If you had a fight and think there is any chance of repair, please do.  You don&rsquo;t know how much time you have.  This message is only for the folks that can have a relationship with their father.  If your father has a history of abuse towards you or someone else, you dont&rsquo; owe them.  If your father refuses to accept you for who you are, you don&rsquo;t owe them.  But if you can have a relationship with them, you owe it not to them, but to yourself, and only you can decide if that&rsquo;s possible.</p>

<p>To the loving fathers out there, happy Father&rsquo;s Day.</p>
