    <p>Yay, first <a href="/categories/personal/">&ldquo;Personal&rdquo;</a> category post!</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m definitely not &ldquo;cool&rdquo; enough to have people tracking my every move (except for my assigned FBI agent.  Hi!), but if you look at my <a href="/100daysofcode">#100daysofcode</a> tracker, you might notice only a single tally mark since the original publication, and a total of &ldquo;1.5.&rdquo;  How could I have completed 1.5 days of code?</p>

<p>Well, I got sick.  It&rsquo;s just a cold, but colds knock me out pretty bad, and they&rsquo;re viruses, so not much can be done about them outside of fluids/rest (technically, I suppose antibiotics could treat them, but I&rsquo;m not contributing to the overuse of antibiotics).  Tuesday morning (my Monday evening, &lsquo;cause overnight shift), I was feeling pretty crummy, but sat down to do more freeCodeCamp, and got about 30 minutes in and decided I needed to be horizontal, so I updated the tracker and went to bed.</p>

<p>When I woke up in the evening, I felt even worse and called out of work.  The last time I got sick, I was a contractor, so I wasn&rsquo;t afforded any PTO.  I had little choice but to come in at that time.  I wore a facemask to try to contain the germs, and was drinking Theraflu and eating cough drops for every shift for the week I was sick.  This time, I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to be a full time employee and have the option to call out without worrying about how I&rsquo;m going to make rent, but it was still a debate because I was stuck in that mindset of &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to call out for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made the right call.  Since Tuesday, I&rsquo;ve been home, spending my time alternating between sleeping and taking as much cold medicine as is safe (always go by the recommended dosages kids).  It has meant I haven&rsquo;t been able to make it to the gym (I&rsquo;ve got about 30lb minimum I want to get rid of), or work on the #100daysofcode challenge, or work on my CySA+ (honestly, I&rsquo;m about ready for that, I think), or cook (pho delivery for the win!).  This has kind of put my life on hold for the last week, which got me thinking.</p>

<p>Outside of ER/urgent care visits, I haven&rsquo;t actually seen a doctor since around the time I turned 18.  That&rsquo;s almost 11 years.  No physicals, no screenings, nothing.  ER has been for the flu, and urgent care was just because I needed a doctor&rsquo;s note for work (that was $200 piece of paper, by the way).  My cat has been to the vet for a checkup more recently than I have.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve done some research.  My girlfriend really likes her provider group, and they&rsquo;re in network for me, so I plan to reach out on second-Monday (since it was pointed out to me that Monday is Memorial Day, Tuesday is now second-Monday).  I think that every step in a positive/self-care direction is supposed to be scary, and this is no different.  I&rsquo;m excited and apprehensive, and plan to make a follow up once I have an appointment (light details, &lsquo;cause personal info).  To my readers, take care of yourself, if you haven&rsquo;t been to doctor in a while and can afford it, make an appointment, at least get a physical.</p>
