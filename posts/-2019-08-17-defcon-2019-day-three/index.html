    <p>Saturday started, like the previous days, at lunch. One of the DeadPixelSec members hit a pretty decent payout and bought us all lunch. Over lunch, we all talked about what we do professionally, what brought us to Defcon, and what we’ve been doing at Defcon. My interactions with these folks have been overwhelmingly positive, on Discord and in person.</p>

<p>We then wandered from there to the vendor room. I didn’t buy anything, but as mentioned in the Day Two coverage, I donated some money for Dead Addict, and the gentleman who bought us lunch, and had the sticker pack thrust upon me (and I’m now an EFF member). I also spoke with the University for Advancing Technologies representatives, and just like with my first time speaking with them five years ago, I find myself wanting to attend.</p>

<p>They’re very nontraditional, both in their course structure, but how you can attend (in-person if you live in the area, online live-streamed, or recorded, and you’re not stuck with one). They also let you pick and choose focuses for your major, and if you don’t have a specific area of focus you want, you can make your own. They don’t do finals, but do final projects. They understand and accomodate neuro-diverse people, something that I could have used greatly when I was working on my Bachelor’s degree.</p>

<p>Five years ago, they weren’t as mature in their online offerings, and I wasn’t in a position to relocate. But now, I think I could reasonably accomplish a Master’s degree, assuming an employer is able to assist with tuition (I’d rather limit the student debt I accumulate from here now that I’m paying it off). Disclaimer: This is not paid, but if UAT wanted to throw some training my way, I wouldn’t complain…</p>

<p>Following the foray into the vendor’s room, we decided to attempt to relax by the pool before eating and going up to Gothcon. The pool was quite different than our idea of relaxing, with loud music, and was considered a place to be (it’s called “The Scene”). We took a quick swim, and a soak in the lukewarm-tub (that was in no way a “hot tub”), and popped off to Sbarro’s for our only bit of fast food the entire trip.</p>

<p>It was time for Gothcon. We had planned to meet at 8PM to help setup, but by the time we got there at 802PM, they were already set up, so we chilled for a bit until it was opened up.</p>

<p>Oh. My. Goth.</p>

<p>It was fantastic. We have good goth nights at home, but this was something different. I think that every scene has a “sound” of sorts, and alot of our local nights have similar sounds as a result. This was a melding of DJs from different areas, and they were in the hacker community and played to the crowd. And the nightclub that it was held in was just packed. We did wander to the other official parties, and with the exception of the Arcade party, it seemed like Gothcon was the place to be on Saturday night.</p>

<p>I was able to get a few good shots of people for my partner’s zine, but unfortunately, the place was rather small and densely packed, and the privacy stance of Defcon led to me having a hard time getting good shots of people without getting other people who might not want to be in the photo/video.</p>

<p>Outside of the party, my partner and I were speaking to one of the new owners of Cryoflesh, who, after a moment, I recognized as someone I met at Defcon 24, and after the con that year, had let me spill my guts to them and really helped me work through some stuff at that time, which was very exciting. I also spoke briefly with Renderman, who was floored that I knew who he was (if you’re reading this, even if you don’t realize it, you’re kind of a big deal).</p>

<p>Once the party wound down, we did offer to help tear down, but there wasn’t really anything to tear down, so we wandered with some of our new friends from the night and the night before for some “drunk o’clock, party’s over” food at the cafe downstairs. We, like every conversation over food, discussed some of what we do, what we’re interested in, and the general state of affairs in the tech community and the world to some extent.</p>

<p>It was a good night, and left only one more day of the con.</p>
