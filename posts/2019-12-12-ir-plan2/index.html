<h1 id="section-2-data-governance">Section 2:  Data Governance</h1>

<p>Every organization should abide by a data governance program.  Data Governance refers to the responsibility of $Company’s leadership to “provide strategic direction, oversight, and accountability for the security of its data and information technology (IT) resources” (Grama, 2011, p. 373).  The ultimate goal of a data governance program is to direct the IT operations and IT security teams to align their strategies with that of the organization as a whole.</p>

<p>Many frameworks exist, including NIST 800, COBIT, COSO, and HITRUST CSE.  Each framework comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, but no matter what framework is used (if one is used), they typically follow the business plans at the following timeframes at minimum:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Strategic planning—Long term planning used to prepare for new advances and directions.</p></li>

<li><p>Tactical planning—Short to medium term (of no more than 6 months) planning used to allow $Company to be responsive to market conditions and take advantage of short term and unexpected opportunites.</p></li>

<li><p>Operational planning—Day to day planning used to focus on the normal operations and respond to daily issues (Grama, 2011, p. 374).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>No matter the time frame that the IT security teams are planning for, they must consider $Company’s information needs, regulatory requirements, risk management, and security failures.  $Company’s information needs are defined by how the organization uses data to meet the business goals and how the operations and security teams can support them.  Regulatory requirements are the requirements that the organization must follow to conduct business in their sphere.  Risk management is the identification and management (mitigation, avoidance, and acceptance) of risks against IT infrastructure.  Security failures are just that:  Failures in the security of the organization and the potential impact of such failures (Grama, 2011, p.375).  Regulatory requirements and risk management shall be discussed in greater length later in this document, and security failures, as the responsibility of the Incident Response teams, shall be constant theme throughout the document.</p>

<p>The data governance program shall document the organization’s approach to information security, and shall address the organization’s information technology and information security goals, how the organization protects its data and the data of others, compliance with legal and regulatory entities, the responsibilities of its employees to secure the organization’s data, and the consequences for not meeting those responsibilities (Grama, 2011, p.379).</p>

<h2 id="data-classification">Data classification</h2>

<p>Data classification is used for both regulatory compliance and risk management, as it is used to identify the types of data that are used on the network (types include personal information, financial information, and health information) and what requirements and risks currently exist against them.  In addition to the type of information, data should also be classified by value (defined using a variety of different metrics), sensitivity (defined by the impact on the organization if leaked), and criticality (defined by the importance to the organization and impact if lost) (Kim &amp; Solomon, 2012, p. 196-197).</p>

<h2 id="incident-response-and-data-governance-for-company">Incident response and data governance for $Company</h2>

<p>As an organization that follows the ISO 27002 data governance framework, $Company’s incident response program shall be informed by Section 16 of the ISO 27002, which is expanded upon by ISO 27035:2016.  Although there is a difference between identified phases of a standard incident response between $Company policy and ISO 27035:2016, the two are comparable, and $Company policy merely expands upon what is outlined in ISO 27035:2016:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b>Incident Response Phases</b> </p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ISO 27035:2016</th>
<th>$Company Incident Response Policy</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Prepare</td>
<td>Prepare</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Identify</td>
<td>Identify</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Assess</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Respond</td>
<td>Contain</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Eradicate</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Recover</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Learn</td>
<td>Review</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><em>This table compares the ISO 27035:2016 phases with those identified within $Company Incident Response policy (IsecT, n.d).</em></p>

<p>As demonstrated in the table above, $Company policy closely aligns with the ISO 27035:2016, although it differs in the merging of Identification and Assessment stage (due to having similar goals), and separating of Response into the Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phases (in order to better expand upon each distinct phase).  Additionally, the procedural framework outlined in the previous section aligns with both the ISO 27035:2016 standard and implementation of $Company Incident Response Policy.</p>
