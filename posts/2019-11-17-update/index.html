    <p>It has been 3 months.  And before that it had been 2.  I&rsquo;m sure not updating this as much as I&rsquo;d like to, but it seems that when I have the time, I don&rsquo;t have the energy, and when I have the energy, I don&rsquo;t have the time, and when I do have both, I just don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>

<p>I finished my studying for CompTIA CySA+ back in September and have plenty of notes that I plan to turn into posts.  &rsquo;ve also been participating in Operation Chimera by Security Blue Team, which is a series of blue team training courses that go over some theory, and then have the participants perform some hands on challenges surrounding the coursework, and it&rsquo;s been a lot of fun, and has given me plenty of ideas for additional posts.</p>

<p>Additionally, today, I shut down my VPS and moved the blog over to Github to save myself a few dollars per month.  You can still find it at the same address, though.  That was a bit of a chore, since I changed machines and apparently Hugo has updated recently and made some pretty extreme changes from what I was used to previously, plus the difficulty of learning git in the process.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also planning on changing the categories from &ldquo;Personal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Professional,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Creative to something along the lines of &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Technical,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Creative.&rdquo;  I still don&rsquo;t have any creative works uploaded, or completed, but I still want to do so once things have settled.</p>

<p>Offline, I&rsquo;m moving to my team&rsquo;s swing shift soon, which should give me a more compatible schedule with my partner, as well as allow me a more stable sleep schedule if I can get to bed before the sun comes up (I&rsquo;ll also enjoy not driving into the sunrise on my way home).  More than that, I have some plans I&rsquo;m working on executing, so stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s about all I got for the moment.  Stay frosty!</p>
