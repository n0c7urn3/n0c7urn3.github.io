<h1 id="section-3-network-security">Section 3: Network Security<a href="#section-3-network-security" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Incident Response is merely a piece of the puzzle when looking at the larger picture of network security.  Each piece of a defensive strategy should complement and be complemented by each other piece.  No piece should be isolated, and no piece should represent a single point of failure.  Incident Response is no different, and is dependent upon the strategies that come before it, and informs those that come after.</p>
<p>Since 2013, an estimated 9.7 trillion records have been stolen in data security breaches, with an estimated 96% having been stolen in unencrypted and usable form (Gemalto, n.d.).  Each breach and record stolen represents not just a failure, but a learning opportunity and example to learn from, and to strive not to be the next example.  To return to the quote from John Chambers:  “There are two types of companies:  Those who know they have been hacked, and those who don’t yet know that they have been hacked” (2015).  Not all hacks, and not all breaches are created equally, and neither are they equally successful.  The number provided from Gemalto only alludes to discovered breaches, true, but also only alludes to successful attacks.  It is a key distinction to make that not all hacks are successful and fruitful.  For every successful attack, there are many more that were met with, if not failure, limited success.  And the difference between the two comes down to a robust defense strategy, and one that focuses on layered defense.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used layered defense models is that of a castle given A) the presence of valuable people and property within, and B) the multiple defenses that would need to be breached (including moats, thick, defensive walls, and high walls for defenders to attack the invaders).  So too, should network have multiple layers and segments of defenses to protect valuable data and users.  Layered network defense is defined as “an approach to network hardening that sets up several network layers to place the most valuable data at the innermost part of the network” (Nelson, Phillips, &amp; Steuart, 2010, p. 657).</p>
<p>Although not as easily mapped out as a physical castle, Kim Everhart of Varonis Security has attempted to distill the model into 6 common layers:  Human, Physical, Endpoint, Network, Application, and Data.  Note that this is not a comprehensive model and each layer may be subdivided based upon context.</p>
<ul>
<li>The human layer concerns human behavior and may be the easiest layer to breach using social engineering techniques.  Exploits against the human layer may take the form of phishing attacks, scams, targeted email attacks, scattering of malicious CDs or USB drives, or even phone calls masquerading as an authorized user.  Mitigations are typically based around training and raising awareness.</li>
<li>The physical layer, as its name implies concerns physical security controls such as security alarms and physical locks.  The physical layer is concerned with making sure that data and devices do not walk out the door, literally.  Ensuring only authorized users are allowed in sensitive areas and that all areas are monitored is key to protecting devices at the physical layer.</li>
<li>The endpoint layer concerns devices such as computers and mobile devices that users may use to access sensitive data and protecting them from malicious software or even hardware and loss.  In order to do so, machines that process sensitive data should use encryption, anti-malware software, and data should be backed up to secure locations.  It is also important to ensure each machine is running a fully updated Operating System, along with whatever other software may be present on the machine.</li>
<li>The network layer concerns the connections between different devices both within and without the internal network.  The goal is to ensure only machines that are authorized to communicate are allowed to and to make sure that there are no unauthorized devices present in network segments that they should not be.  Common security controls on the network include VPNs, firewalls, and IDS/IPS devices, both to segment the network, and monitor traffic for suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Application security concerns the software that an organization runs and ensures that all pieces are safe to use, or at least mitigates their risk and possible impact.  Securing the application layer should take the form of regular testing and patching.  Although it may not be practical to run completely up to date software (due to vendor support or compatibility concerns), it is a goal to be strived for, and those softwares that are unable to be patched should be isolated as much as possible to limit their exposure.</li>
<li>The data layer, finally, concerns the actual data on the network, and in most cases will be an attacker’s final target.  Securing the data layer ultimately comes down to ensuring that only the people with legitimate business need have access to data.  Identity management and the rule of least privilege are key to securing this layer (2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, a common thread to each layer is monitoring.  Know what you have, know what is happening to it, and know who to alert when something improper is detected.  This can be difficult to do, and will require continuous fine tuning.  But detection of an incident early may mean the difference between a new-worthy incident occurring and stopping a breach toward the start.  Just like the actual securing of the network, monitoring should be performed in layers, and users can even make up a layer (they may notice something weird that a monitoring system misses).</p>
<p>No matter what the source of the alert may have been or what layer it occurred on, it is up to the Incident Response teams to investigate and mitigate damage once an incident has been reported.  An organization may have one or multiple incident response teams depending on size, and they may respond to different types of incidents or incidents against different targets.  Ultimately, it is the Incident Response team that decides what to do in response to an attack or breach (with the input of the appropriate business owners) according to the appropriate response procedure.</p>
<p>As has previously mentioned every failure is a learning opportunity, and given the near certainty of a breach occurring, no security team should unfairly blame or criticize themselves for the occurrence of a breach (except for cases of gross negligence), and instead should review the incident post-mortem and determine what techniques worked and which did not, and where there is room for improvement in the organizational security model.</p>
<h2 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment<a href="#risk-assessment" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Risks assessments should be wargamed with Incident Response personnel, business owners, and Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) personnel.  Wargame exercises shall be performed twice a year in order to stay abreast and prevent stagnation.  A helpful tool for wargaming may be the DR Board Game, which may be printed free for use in wargame exercises.  In the DR Board Game, the Incident Response teams, business owners, and BC/DR teams draw cards representing disaster scenarios and respond to the disaster with their own expertise and knowledge of existing mitigations in order to describe how the organization will respond if that particular disaster occurs (Faith, n.d.).</p>
<p>Example scenarios from the Faith’s DR Board Game and potential mitigations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware failure that causes outage of communications equipment.
<ul>
<li>Spares on site to reduce downtime</li>
<li>Backups that are regularly performed and tested</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Malware attack not stopped by existing anti-malware defenses
<ul>
<li>Robust and tuned monitoring of critical infrastructure for abnormalities</li>
<li>Well documented response procedures for a multitude of different threats</li>
<li>Backups that are regularly performed and tested</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Denial of service (DoS) attack
<ul>
<li>DoS mitigation services such as Cloudflare or Akamai</li>
<li>Edge IPS that has DoS mitigation built in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Theft of server equipment
<ul>
<li>Full disk encryption to render data unreadable</li>
<li>GPS trackers for particularly sensitive equipment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local Telco outage
<ul>
<li>Redundant and diversified circuits (including both the national provider and last mile carrier)</li>
<li>Critical system duplication to allow staff to continue work and reconcile differences later</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the risk assessment should be fed into a Risk Management Framework.  NIST’s Risk Management Framework contains the following major steps within the cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Categorize
<ul>
<li>Identify systems on the network and classify them based on the information they process, store, and transmit and impact of data/system loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select
<ul>
<li>Create a baseline set of security controls based on categorization.  Following the baseline, controls may be customized/tailored according to business needs and risk assessment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement
<ul>
<li>Implement and document the security controls chosen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assessment
<ul>
<li>Assess the implemented security controls based on if they are implemented correctly, operating correctly, and producing a satisfactory outcome regarding security requirements per system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Authorize
<ul>
<li>Following risk assessment and mitigations/acceptance, the systems shall be authorized for use within the organization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monitor
<ul>
<li>All implemented security controls shall be monitored and assessed regularly to ensure that they continue to work as required and also to determine if the risks have changed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
