<h1 id="section-4-asset-security-management">Section 4:  Asset Security Management</h1>

<p>Security practitioners face many issues when determining best how to secure an organization, but asset management is among the most challenging and the most critical.  One cannot protect what one does not know exists.  A properly executed IT Asset Management program could mean the difference between a well run network and a hodgepodge of poor documentation that creates easily access footholds for attackers.</p>

<p>At a minimum, an IT Asset Management program should track the authorized equipment on the network and the information that describes it, including location, user info, configurations, and roles and responsibility (Brien, 2016).  Not only are these details useful to the different IT Security teams in order to identify assets and secure those valuable to the organization, but it also aids IT Operations as knowing this information allows the Operations teams (such as help desk and administrators) to better support the users and assets.</p>

<p>As the organization grows, the difficult of asset management grows as well.  While a mom and pop shop with 5 computers can be easily tracked by a manually updated spreadsheet, it is not feasible to do the same for an organization with hundreds or thousands of machines.  Although some information may be collected on deployment, an asset management software system should be deployed to collect data after initial asset deployment, and regular reports generated and reviewed to ensure that the system is up to date by checking the last date a machine’s entry was updated, and that all new deployments are accounted for.</p>

<p>In addition to asset management, some systems also allow for remote management and monitoring that can aid support teams and security teams alike by enabling the deployment of scripts and patches and tracking unauthorized software.  These Remote Management and Monitoring (RMM) systems are also capable of monitoring and alerting for abnormal of potential risks before they become a problem, or worse, an incident (Continuum Managed Services, n.d.).</p>

<p>RMMs typically consist of a server and an agent to be installed on each machine.  The agent records information about the system on which it’s installed and reports it back to the server.  The server can then be accessed by members of operations and security teams alike to monitor status, software inventory, and manage the machine remotely and nonintrusively.  In the case where a technician or engineer must manually interact with the machine, most RRMs also include a remote control component (Continuum Managed Services, n.d.).</p>

<p>RMMs therefore provide much value to any asset management program and satisfy other monitoring and management programs as well, and any organization that is struggling to track and support their assets should at the very least investigate whether or not an RMM would satisfy their requirements.</p>
