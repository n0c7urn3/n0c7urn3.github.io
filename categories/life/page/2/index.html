      Day -1: The Drive I have forgotten how much the drive to Las Vegas takes it out of you. My first time in Vegas was just for a friend’s birthday party. We (my friend, her boyfriend, and I) piled into my Subaru Forester, and off we went. We took turns driving on the way there, and on the way back, I decided to challenge myself. I drove the entire way home myself, and we only stopped for gas.

I resented my father. Past tense. For a couple of reasons. The obvious one is that he passed shortly before I turned 18. The other reason is that I&rsquo;ve come to terms with our differences.
My father loved me. He adored me. And he wanted the best for me (even threatened to leave my mother and take me with him during a time when her drug use was at one of its peaks), and he did his damndest to provide for me and my mother.

      I think we all have a specific moment in which we learn to trust that little voice in the back of our heads; the one that tells us, &ldquo;You should run.&rdquo; Sometimes it&rsquo;s wrong, and you have to look at the situation to figure that out, but sometimes listening to it is the best choice you can make.
To provide some background, both of my parents were recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, and both attended our local Alcoholics Anonymous club (henceforth referred to as &ldquo;the Club&rdquo;).

      Yay, first &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; category post!
So, I&rsquo;m definitely not &ldquo;cool&rdquo; enough to have people tracking my every move (except for my assigned FBI agent. Hi!), but if you look at my #100daysofcode tracker, you might notice only a single tally mark since the original publication, and a total of &ldquo;1.5.&rdquo; How could I have completed 1.5 days of code?
Well, I got sick. It&rsquo;s just a cold, but colds knock me out pretty bad, and they&rsquo;re viruses, so not much can be done about them outside of fluids/rest (technically, I suppose antibiotics could treat them, but I&rsquo;m not contributing to the overuse of antibiotics).

      Two years ago today, I walked into CenturyLink for my first day. I was nervous as hell, and, coming out of the MSP/desktop support space, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was going to be able to do the work, but a friend of mine that I met while attending ITT knew I was looking and referred me.
Here&rsquo;s the thing, she said I should do it before we ever even finished our degrees, and that was back in 2013.
